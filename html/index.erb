## Installing

To add the repository put this before the call to `package-initialize`
in your `init.el` file.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1679158.js"> </script>

Please read about [known issues](#known-issues) below before
attempting to install multiple packages at once.

## Known Issues

Due to the way the HTTP routing works on my provider, the HTTP/1.1
connection will time out for long package installs -- where the
package is large and takes a while to compile -- like *magit* or *evil*.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1679208.js"> </script>

This makes things a tad more slow but means that the install completes
correctly. Otherwise the connection times out and the install goes haywire.

### Fixes for `package.el`

There are a number of small bugs in Emacs24's `package.el`. First,
when installing dependencies, the packages were not getting
initialized.  Second, the order for dependencies was coming out
backwards for what I needed.  Both problems are
 easily patched by some *advice*.

## Updating Packages

`package.el` now includes a mechanism to upgrade packages.  After running `package-list-pacages`, type *u* (mark Upgradable packages) and then *x* (eXecute the installs and deletions).  When it's done installing all the packages it will ask if you want to delete the obsolete packages and so you can hit *y* (Yes).

If you run into a problem installing or upgrading, you may need to go into your `~/.emacs.d/elpa/` directory and delete packages that are installed multiple times.  This can happen when the install times out (see [Known Issues](#known-issues)).

## Development

[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa)

Contributions are welcome.  Currently, the builder only supports
packages using git, subversion, mercurial, and darcs.  This covers
most of the packages that I am interested in.
