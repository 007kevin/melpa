# MELPA

Repository of code for *MELPA* or *Milkypostman's ELPA* or *Milkypostman's Experimental Lisp Package Repository* if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

### Checking out

    git clone git://github.com/milkypostman/melpa.git
    git sm init
    git sm update


## Scripts

* `buildpkg` -- Create an archive of the package(s) passed as
arguments to the script. Built packages are put in the `packages/`
folder with version corresponding to the newest HEAD revision
available; given according to the `%Y%m%d` format.

* `melpa` -- All the logic for generating everything in
the repository based on the `pkglist` file.  By default this will
update the [epkgs] repository, build all packages listed in `pkglist`,
compile the `index.html` file for the [melpa] website front page, and
sync with the site.

    The following arguments are accepted,

    update
    :   update the epkgs repository

    clear
    :   clean out the `packages/` directory

    build
    :   build all packages in `pkglist`

    index
    :   build the `index.html` file

    sync
    :   sync built files with the repository

## Code

The `package-build.el` file contains all the heavy lifting. The
scripts above call the `package-build-archive` function from the
command-line to actually build the package(s).

 Alternatively you can
load this file from within Emacs and issues commands from there.




## Adding Packages

Feel free to open an Issue requesting packages and I'll see if they
build nicely.

## Developement

Fork away!  Send me some pull requests.

### Notes

Packages end up in the `packages/` directory by default.
This can be configured using the `package-build-archive-dir` variable.

Repositories are checked out to the `working/` directory by default.
This can be configured using the `package-build-working-dir` variable.

All metadata for building the packages is based off the git submodule
for the [`epkgs`][epkgs] repository generated by the
[emacsmirror][emacsmirror].  *However,* currently the site is not
keeping up-to-date so I have [mirrored the site][mepkgs].
